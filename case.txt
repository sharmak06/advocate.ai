ORAL ORDER
2 16-10-2025 1.Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and
learned A.P.P. for the State.
2.The petitioners apprehend their arrest in a case
registered for the offences punishable under Sections 80, 238
and 3(5) of the BNS, 2023.
3.Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that
petitioners are persons with clean antecedent and the informant
alleges that his cousin sister was married to Hari Shankar in the
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.71852 of 2025(2) dt.16-10-2025
2/4
year 2020, after marriage, the husband along with his parents
started torturing her for dowry, further on 24.03.2025, the sister-
in-law of his sister namely Reena (Gotni) called and informed
that named accused persons including the petitioners
strangulated the victim to death, accordingly, the informant
came to the place of occurrence and the dead body was sent for
postmortem by the police.
4.Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that
petitioners have been falsely implicated in the instant case by
the informant. It is further submitted that no doubt the death of
the victim took place within seven years of marriage, as such,
there is a presumption in law against the husband of the
deceased and his family members, but then all deaths are not
dowry deaths. It is further submitted that even demand of dowry
is general and omnibus in nature and informant is not an eye
witness to the occurrence. It is next submitted that had the
petitioners been involved in the occurrence, in that event efforts
would have been made to dispose of the dead body with a view
to conceal evidence, but then from perusal of the allegation as
alleged in the FIR, it would manifest that the dead body was
lying in the house and the same was sent for postmortem by the
police. It is reiterated and submitted that had the petitioners

been involved in the occurrence, in that event efforts would
have been made to ensure that the dead body is not sent for
postmortem or else the cause of death would be ascertained. It is
next submitted that petitioner no. 4 is father-in-law of the
deceased and rest of the petitioners are agnates of the husband
of the deceased and they reside separately. It is further submitted
that husband of the deceased is in custody. It is next submitted
that petitioners will not abscond rather will cooperate in the
investigation to prove their innocence.
5.Learned A.P.P. for the State opposes the prayer for
anticipatory bail of the petitioners.
6.Considering the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the petitioners, the petitioners above-named, in the
event of their arrest or surrender before the learned trial court
